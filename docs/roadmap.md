# Ruckig C Post-Release Roadmap

This roadmap keeps the `0.1.0` release scope locked while preserving concrete
follow-up work for stability and future feature planning.

## 0.1.x Stability Queue

- Done for `0.1.1`: fixed regression cases for 3 DoF high-frequency online
  update loops, near-limit velocity control, very small `delta_time`, mixed
  disabled/active DoFs, discrete duration plus minimum duration, and
  directional min velocity/min acceleration edge values.
- Done for `0.1.1`: C API diagnostics tests and `docs/api_diagnostics.md`.
- Done for `0.1.1`: minimal offline and online examples wired into CMake and
  CTest.
- Done for `0.1.1`: patch-release performance recording procedure in
  `docs/performance_report.md`.
- Done for `0.1.1`: frozen upstream baseline policy in
  `docs/upstream_baseline_policy.md`.
- Remaining for later `0.1.x`: record final Windows and Linux benchmark
  results for each patch release, including average, p99, worst, and C/oracle
  average ratio.
- Remaining for later `0.1.x`: expand downstream consumer notes if new
  packaging or toolchain-specific issues appear.

## 0.2.0 Feature Planning

- Done for `0.2.0`: per-DoF control-interface and synchronization overrides
  implemented after the dedicated design document in
  `docs/design_per_dof_overrides.md`.
- Done for `0.2.0`: fixed oracle cases compare mixed per-DoF control and
  synchronization settings against the frozen C++ baseline.
- Defer waypoints and per-section constraints until a separate design addresses the Community cloud/pro behavior boundary.
- Defer Python and Rust bindings until the C ABI has stabilized through `0.1.x`.
- Treat any upstream Ruckig baseline update as a separate project with source inventory, tolerance review, oracle corpus updates, full random stress, and new performance baselines.
